    [!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "flutter_string_encryption":
      In Podfile:
        flutter_string_encryption (from `Pods/.symlinks/plugins/flutter_string_encryption-0.0.1/ios`)

    Specs satisfying the `flutter_string_encryption (from `Pods/.symlinks/plugins/flutter_string_encryption-0.0.1/ios`)` dependency were found, but they required a higher minimum deployment target.
